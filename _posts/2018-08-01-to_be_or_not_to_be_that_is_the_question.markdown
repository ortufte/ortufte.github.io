In Shakespeare's famous soliloquy, he ponders the question; to be alive or to be dead. One can take this in a literal sense of course, but often those who come after famous writers and philosphers translate their writings into prose that relates to one's own life. 

As a wife and mother of three, working in an industry that I find unfulfilling, Shakespeare's opening line encompasses my journey into Web Development.  I could continue to advance my career as a project coordinator for a construction company, in a position that pays well but (for me) leaves much to be desired in the way of personal growth. OR, I could follow my heart and mind into a field that promises opportunity for continual intellectual stimulation and contribution to society as a whole.

When weighing the consequences, what will you choose?
